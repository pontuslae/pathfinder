# Summary
Pathfinder builds on a simple concept of finding the most ideal path from one node on a map to another. 
The projects' scope grew as I wanted to have a auto-generated node network (a map) for the algorithms to on. 


# Planned features
Using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
Using A* algorithm to find the most direct path.
Creating an illustration of the map. Either as an image or via the command line.
Selection of transportation and making some nodes only accessible via specific transits.

# Estimated finish
The project should be in the polishing phase during early-mid September. But it's only an estimate as the programming language is new to me and unexpected difficulties might appear.
