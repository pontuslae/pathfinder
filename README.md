# What is this?
Pathfinder builds on a simple concept of creating and linking nodes on a image surface. 
The projects' scope grew as I wanted to have a auto-generated node network (a map) for the algorithms to on. 

# Examples
Inside the examples directory you can find examples if implementation. 

# Planned features
- Visualize a input data file.
- Better abstraction for groups.
- Less randomness and more control.
