# Introduction
Pathfinder can create nodes, groups of nodes and connection in between them, and plot them resulting in an image.
It handles text interpretation and data visualisation based on input files.
# Examples
Inside the examples directory you can find example implementations of common functions.

# Planned activities
- Upload api and documentation.
- Better abstraction for groups of nodes.
- More predictable node layout.
- Integrate with piston for live-view.
